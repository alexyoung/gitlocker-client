This is a client for "Gitlocker":http://github.com/alexyoung/gitlocker/ and it includes a Rails plugin.

The Rails plugin isn't fully tested yet, it's still being actively developed.  Fortunately it's fairly simple!

h3. Installation

# <code>gem install gitlocker</code>
# <code>gem install gitlocker-client</code>
# Run gitlocker: <code>gitlocker</code>
# Add the plugin to your project's <code>environment.rb</code> file: <code>config.gem 'gitlocker-client', :lib => 'rails'</code>
# Add gitlocker to one of your models

<code>
  gitlocker 'http://localhost:4567',
    :fields  => :source,
    :repo_id => Proc.new { |d| "my_app_#{d.user_id}" }
</code>

Gitlocker should be installed somewhere as a proper rack app for production.
